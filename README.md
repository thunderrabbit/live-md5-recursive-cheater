This is just a plaintext list of precomputed entries.

The digits in the left column represent the numeric values of the end
of the md5 strings.  They are zero padded to make sorting easier.

Some strings include the characters "\n" which represent linebreaks.
When verifying the string, replace the \n with a carriage return or
the MD5 will not match the numbers to the left.

Vague future ideas

Eventually I'd like to make an interface to filter these easily.

For example, the string 'a' could be used at 269772661.  I doubt we'll
get that far, but we will much(!) more likely get to 661 where 'a'
could be used.  And again at 2661, and again at 72661.  Trust me if we
get that far, people will love to see such short strings again.
